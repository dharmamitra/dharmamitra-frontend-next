Leveraging a robust corpus of over four million sentence pairs from various sourcesand utilizing Google's MADLAD-400 model as a foundation, MITRA has fine-tuned a specialized translation model that not only promises enhanced fluency in translations but also aims to significantly expand access to ancient wisdom texts.",
