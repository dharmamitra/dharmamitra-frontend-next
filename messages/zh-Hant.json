      "p1": "The MITRA project, spearheaded by Kurt Keutzer and Sebastian Nehrdich, focuses on bridging the linguistic divide between ancient wisdom source languages and contemporary languages through the application of advanced Deep Learning and AI technologies.",
      "p2": "Initiated in 2023, the project quickly evolved from its conceptual phase to a dynamic development process, accelerated  by its collaborative efforts with organizations such as monlam.ai and with contributions from a diverse array of sources, including translators and AI researchers. Leveraging a robust corpus of over four million sentence pairs from various sourcesand utilizing Google's MADLAD-400 model as a foundation, MITRA has fine-tuned a specialized translation model that not only promises enhanced fluency in translations but also aims to significantly expand access to ancient wisdom texts.",
      "p3": "Through continuous improvements in data quality, sentence alignment, and model fine-tuning, the project seeks to overcome the challenges inherent in low-resource language translation. The MITRA project stands as a testament to the transformative potential of AI in transcending language barriers, embodying a commitment to cultural preservation, academic research, and the democratization of access to Tibetan literature and wisdom."
