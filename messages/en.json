      "p2": "Initiated in 2023, the project quickly evolved from its conceptual phase to a dynamic development process, accelerated  by its collaborative efforts with organizations such as monlam.ai and with contributions from a diverse array of sources, including translators and AI researchers. Leveraging a robust corpus of over four million sentence pairs from various sourcesand utilizing Google's MADLAD-400 model as a foundation, MITRA has fine-tuned a specialized translation model that not only promises enhanced fluency in translations but also aims to significantly expand access to Buddhist texts.",
      "p3": "Through continuous improvements in data quality, sentence alignment, and model fine-tuning, the project seeks to overcome the challenges inherent in low-resource language translation. The MITRA project stands as a testament to the transformative potential of AI in transcending language barriers, embodying a commitment to cultural preservation, academic research, and the democratization of access to Tibetan literature and wisdom."
