Adding news to the Mitra site should relatively painless, but there are a few things to note. The below outlines the process, highlighting the key details.

## Update workflow

1. `git switch main && git pull`
2. `git switch content-updates && git merge main`
3. Add a new post directory in `src/content/news/`
   - make sure the directory name follows the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug`
4. Add an `en` (add any other required [supported locale](src/i18n/index.ts)) mdx file(s) to the post directory (eg. `2025-02-09-show-case/en.mdx`) and draft the post content.
5. Commit and push the changes
6. Open a PR
7. Once approved it will be merged into `main` and ready for deployment to production.

## File content

### <span style={{ color: "red" }}>Required frontmatter</span>

- make sure the mdx file inclides the required frontmatter (see [`NewsPostFrontmatterSchema`](src/content/schemas.ts) and other news posts in the directory for reference)
- this content populates both the `/news` page and the header of the post page if one is created.

### Optional Markdown content:

- if Markdown content is added to the mdx file, this will trigger the generation of a dedicated news article page (otherwise the post's frontmatter will just be listed on the `/news` page).
- the markdown content should not contain a `h1` (`#`) as this is automatically added by the news post page layout using the `title` frontmatter value.

#### Markdown example

Content can be drafted using regular [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). In addition, as posts are rendered using MDX, supported MDX components can be used (at the moment this only extends to `MDXImage`, but custom components can be added to the project as needed).

##### External links

[External link](https://www.google.com) can be used as normal, but because the project has localization support, local links must give the slug in the default language (en) and localisation will be sorted out under the hood (eg. `[local team page link](/team)`).

##### Images

Any images used in the post:

- must be added to the `public/assets/news` directory
  - logic is in place to resolve base path handling for different build variants.
  - image files should be sized down to a reasonable size (eg. 1000px wide)
- only need to give the image file name as the `src` value (eg. `apexinfinity-games-korean-robot.png`).

In most cases, images can use normal markdown syntax (eg. `![alt text](jacquard-loom.jpg)`).

If an image needs custom styling, the `MDXImage` component can be imported into the mdx file and used as follows:

```mdx
---
... frontmatter ...
---

import MDXImage from "@/components/MDXImage"

... content ...

<MDXImage
  src="jacquard-loom.jpg"
  alt="Jacquard Loom, Alf van Beem"
  maxHeight={500}
  style={{
    margin: "2rem auto",
    display: "block",
    padding: "1rem",
  }}
/>
```

<figure>
  <MDXImage
    src="jacquard-loom.jpg"
    alt="Jacquard Loom, Alf van Beem"
    maxHeight={500}
    style={{
      margin: "2rem auto",
    }}
/>

## Localization

The project is localized (see [supported locales](src/i18n/index.ts)). Each news post must have an `en.mdx` file. Other supported locales can optionally be added by creating a new file with the locale code (eg. `zh-Hant.mdx`) in the news post directory.
