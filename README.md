# dharmamitra-frontend-next

Dharmamitra frontend v2 â€” a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the home page generated by `src/app/page.tsx`.

This project uses:

- [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
- [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs) ([examples](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/examples)).
    - [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/charts) local codes used by [Javascripts's Internationalization API](https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-implementation-dependencies) are used for `/messages/` files.
    - `/messages/` files use the convention of title-case keys for page content and camel-case keys for component content. 

## Next.js

# Containerization

## Simple setting

```
docker build . --tag dmnext  --no-cache
docker run --detach --rm --publish 3333:3000 --name dmnext dmnext
docker stop dmnext
```

3000 seems to be the default port for many apps based on Node.js 
and here we publish it on local port 3333 
so that the probabiloty is less for it to compete with other locally deployed apps (e.g. BN)

## Compose setting

```
docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up --force-recreate -d
```

NGINX is added to the docker-compose setting so that the environment is more production-like with a webserver in front of the app.
The app is again available under `localhost:3333` e.g. `http://localhost:3333/dmnext/bo/about`.
The server (published locally on port 80) functions as a proxy so the same page should be reachable over `http://localhost/dmnext/bo/about`

If you want to see the NGINX logs you can use (press Ctrl-C to exit):

```
docker logs nginx -f
```
